# Projects from a Udemy course called `Ethical Hacking with Go Programming language`
> These are the projects i wrote following [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/golang-hacking) course - the code I've uploaded here is the exact same as what the course author wrote, so **don't blame the bad practices on me** haha (I noticed that too)

## Usage
Build the victim executeable for Windows with `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui -o image.exe main.go`
